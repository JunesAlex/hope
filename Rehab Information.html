                        <!-- all the informations that the website have are real and could help people to understand the addictions-->
                        <p><br>Drug rehab facilities help drug addicts prepare to re-enter society. Drug addiction often changes a person's behavior, which can affect all aspects of his or her life, including work and relationships. In drug rehab, patients
                            do their best to regain their normal lives in a safe and healthy way.&nbsp;<br><br>There are many different types of drug rehab facilities. Some specialize in helping patients with a specific drug addiction; others offer a
                            broader range of drug addiction services. Some rehab facilities are even gender- or age-specific, as this often helps patients feel more comfortable in the rehab setting. Inpatient and outpatient rehab facilities are also available.&nbsp;<br><br>Drug
                            rehab treatment centers often carry the stigma that patients are forced to stay. However, this stereotype is untrue. Patients in rehab centers are free to leave anytime they choose to. One reason for this is that drug rehab
                            can only be truly effective when the patient has a desire to be there and to change his or her addictive habits. That being said, in instances where individuals are compelled to go to rehab -- such as via a court order -- the
                            rehab process can still be effective, even if they were initially reluctant to go.&nbsp;<br><br>Drug rehab centers range from very basic facilities to luxury treatment centers. The type of center a patient attends depends upon
                            his or her budget and level of insurance coverage. While luxury centers offer more amenities than basic facilities, they are not always the best treatment centers. Patients should investigate a rehab facility before making
                            a final decision.&nbsp;<br><br>Before entering a rehab facility, patients may have to undergo detox treatment. Detox is the process in which a patient rids his or her body of the addictive substance. This process usually takes
                            about a week and is monitored by doctors and nurses. Once a patient completes detox, he or she is ready for rehab.&nbsp;<br><br>Drug rehab treatment facilities help patients change their attitudes toward drugs. Many times drug
                            addicts deny that they have an addiction and sometimes even claim that the drug is not harmful. The first step in rehab is to help patients get past this denial so that they can make an effort to change.<br><br></p>

                            <h4>Committing to Recovery</h4>
                            <p><br>Doctors and counselors in rehab centers help patients make goals for themselves. Patients commit to themselves and their loved ones that they will strive to make a positive change in their lives. They make long-term goals
                                and then short-term goals that help them along the way.&nbsp;<br><br>To help patients overcome denial and make healthy choices and commitments, doctors educate them on the consequences and effects of drug abuse and addiction.
                                Patients learn about the effects that the drugs have on their bodies in the hopes that they will be more motivated to make a change.&nbsp;<br><br>Drug rehab treatment centers offer frequent individual counseling to patients.
                                These counseling sessions sometimes even take place on a daily basis. Counselors help patients discover any emotional or psychological factors that may have contributed to their addictions. It is important that these psychological
                                factors are addressed if a patient is to make a full recovery.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition to individual counseling, patients in rehab often participate in group therapy. Patients with similar addictions meet together under
                                the direction of a counselor. This allows them to form friendships and to have fellowship with one another. These close personal bonds aid patients on their road to recovery.&nbsp;<br><br>Patients in drug rehab learn to
                                recognize situations that may trigger drug abuse. These triggers could be emotional, physical, part of relationships, or simply part of their normal routines. Counselors and doctors help patients learn how to combat those
                                triggers and get out of circumstances that may lead them to abuse drugs.&nbsp;<br><br>Once patients learn to recognize drug abuse triggers, they learn the skills needed to cope with them. Counselors and doctors in drug
                                rehab treatment facilities work with each patient to come up with a personalized set of coping skills that the patient can use to prevent him or her from turning to drugs.&nbsp;<br>Counselors also help rehab patients change
                                their negative habits that are related to their addictions. This could include changing leisure activities or even changing aspects of the addict's career or everyday life. The goal is to reduce the amount of stress and
                                triggers in the patient's life to keep him or her from relapsing.<br><br></p>

                            long term, depending on the patient's circumstances and needs.<br><br></p>
