                        <!-- all the stories are real but i changed the names of these people because on the website that i get these stories it was a policy to change the names of these people-->
                        <p class="text-left">My parents got divorced when I was very young and my mom remarried.&nbsp; I consider my stepfather my dad and he thinks of me as his daughter.&nbsp; I had a really good childhood.&nbsp; I was given every opportunity—all the love
                            and affection you could imagine. &nbsp;But this disease can happen to anyone.&nbsp; My biological father was an addict and I believe for me, addiction is hereditary.&nbsp; As a kid, I always felt different.&nbsp; I was overweight,
                            and I’d hide food and eat it.&nbsp; I’d lie to friends and steal money from my parents.&nbsp; I was awkward and scared of everything.At 15, I got drunk for the first time and liked it.&nbsp; On my 16thbirthday, I got&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;drunk.&nbsp;
                            I was scared that my parents would be angry, but they ended up saying, “We’re not mad.&nbsp; We’re just disappointed.”&nbsp; After that, I basically became a dry drunk.&nbsp; I was really into punk rock and had a lot of teen
                            angst. &nbsp;When I was 18, I was in community college and I tried cocaine for the first time.&nbsp; The combination of alcohol and coke really did it for me.&nbsp; I barely finished college.&nbsp; I lived above a head shop
                            and started tattooing, which played into my partying lifestyle.&nbsp; Later on, I moved to Boston and stopped tattooing.&nbsp; My drinking and drugs came first.By the time I left Boston, I was having trouble getting out of
                            bed, my hair was falling out, and my skin was terrible.&nbsp; I moved back into my mom’s house in New Hampshire, but it took me a year and couple of arrests before I realized I needed help.&nbsp; One day, I was on my way to
                            go drink and I got a DUI.&nbsp; I was at double the legal limit and I felt like I hadn’t even started drinking.&nbsp; That’s how high my tolerance was.&nbsp; I thought, “God, I’m 26!&nbsp; This isn’t how I want to lead my life.”&nbsp;
                            I went to an intensive outpatient program, and that’s when I realized I really had a problem.Unfortunately, the program wasn’t enough to keep me sober.&nbsp; My thinking was so warped that I told myself, “You’re a drunken cokehead.&nbsp;
                            You can try heroin!”&nbsp; I used heroin for about a month and a half.&nbsp; During that time, I remember getting on my knees and begging God to help me because I was so weak. &nbsp;I started calling detoxes and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.phoenixhouse.org/locations/new-hampshire/phoenix-house-franklin-center/">Phoenix House Franklin</a>&nbsp;was
                            the first to call me back.&nbsp; I went through detox and then transitional living; I worked during the day and came back to Franklin at night.&nbsp; Then, one day I went out and used.&nbsp; Instead of lying about it, I told
                            the staff that I had relapsed and needed help.&nbsp; The amazing thing is, they didn’t kick me out.&nbsp; They saw something in me that I couldn’t see in myself.In September 2009, they sent me to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.phoenixhouse.org/locations/new-hampshire/phoenix-house-keene-center/">Phoenix House Keene Center</a>&nbsp;and
                            I haven’t used since.&nbsp; After two weeks, I came back to Franklin and stayed in transitional housing for four months.&nbsp; The program had 24-hour counseling available, a supportive group of peers, required meetings—everything
                            I needed to get my life back on track.&nbsp; The staff wasn’t scared to tell me, “This is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>OK.”&nbsp; They really pushed me. After I left Phoenix House, I decided I didn’t want to lose contact.&nbsp; I
                            started volunteering and speaking about my recovery.Every week, I do recovery-related art with the clients.&nbsp; In one of my exercises,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I have them fold a piece of paper and then draw all the things
                            they like on one side of the crease.&nbsp; It can be anything: music, sunsets, friends, family.&nbsp; On the other side, I have them draw their drug of choice.&nbsp; By the time they’re done, one side of the paper is filled
                            with cool stuff and the other is just barren.&nbsp; I tell them, “This is your choice.&nbsp; If you want&nbsp;<em>that,&nbsp;</em>all this goes away.”&nbsp; Some clients have a hard time filling up the page with things they
                            like.&nbsp; I say, “That’s because drugs have stripped you of everything.”&nbsp; It’s a really powerful visual.I now have three and a half years clean.&nbsp; I’ll finish my B.F.A. in May and I was just accepted to a prestigious
                            graduate arts program in New Mexico.&nbsp; I’m studying to become a professional lithographer; lithography is a printmaking process using limestone.&nbsp; I feel like my art mirrors my life.&nbsp; You can do anything using
                            the stone, but you have to follow certain steps—just like I have to follow certain steps in life to bring my goals to fruition.Today, I’m proud of my relationships with friends and family.&nbsp; One of the best parts of my
                            recovery has been my renewed connection with my sister.&nbsp; For a long time, she wanted nothing to do with me.&nbsp; It’s been a process, but in the last six months, she’s started to come around.&nbsp; Just the other day,
                            she texted me about a new purse she bought.&nbsp; It seems like a small thing, but I thought, “She could have told anyone and she told&nbsp;<em>me.</em>”&nbsp; We love each other, and she finally has a big sister again.If it
                            weren’t for Phoenix House, I would’ve ended up in jail.&nbsp; I keep in contact with the staff and I know that if I’m having a problem, I can go in and the counselors will take time out of their day for me.&nbsp; I could stop
                            by today if I needed to.&nbsp; The thing I’d tell people who are struggling is, “Just give yourself a chance.&nbsp; You’re worth it.”&nbsp; I am not an exception.&nbsp; Anyone can do this if they try.<br><br></p>
