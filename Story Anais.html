                        <!-- all the stories are real but i changed the names of these people because on the website that i get these stories it was a policy to change the names of these people-->
                        <p class="text-left">I grew up in New York City and went to a really prestigious high school. It was the type of school where there were a lot of expectations—pressure to go on to places like Harvard, Columbia or Yale. So when I first did cocaine and
                            it actually&nbsp;<em>helped&nbsp;</em>me do better in school, I was hooked. Maybe it was a weird reason to start using, but it was definitely a real one! At the time I had no idea that my drug use would end up wreaking havoc
                            on me both physically and mentally. I had no idea that cocaine would take away my friends, my health, and my independence.But all of that came later—at first I loved cocaine. I could sit in philosophy class and answer all the
                            questions the teacher asked, while writing my thesis paper for English class at the same time. I was multitasking like crazy. I wrote a five-page poem while I was high and it ended up getting published. At the time, it seemed
                            like the cocaine was making me a better person. There was absolutely no way in hell I would stop.At the beginning the coke made me feel really social, but eventually it isolated me from everyone. None of my friends did coke
                            as much as I did; my use became taboo and I began to hide it. I was even able to hide it from my therapist. I developed a good relationship with my drug dealer for whom I’d do favors in exchange for money or more cocaine. I’d
                            transport drugs to upstate New York and leave them with another dealer (kind of like drug trafficking), which enabled me to maintain this crazy (and expensive) new habit. At the worst of it, when I was 18, I was blowing 1.5
                            to 2 grams a day. That sounds completely crazy to me today; I can barely drink coffee anymore!My parents didn’t know anything about my use; all they knew was that I was doing well in school. It’s funny how oblivious parents
                            can be. My boyfriend at the time was completely straight-edge and didn’t suspect anything. I managed to hide my drug use while I ripped through school, got all As in honors classes, and sold coke every weekend.Of course things
                            eventually began to get out of control. I had sore throats every night; it felt like I had a constant case of strep. I weighed about 90 pounds. I didn’t eat anymore. I would get nosebleeds randomly in the middle of the day.
                            I had ulcers in my stomach. It felt as if I had the flu all the time, but coke would subdue the symptoms. I was falling apart. I remember there was one night when I couldn’t go to sleep because I was too high. I didn’t&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to
                            do coke at that point, but I felt like I&nbsp;<em>had&nbsp;</em>to. It was 2AM and I wanted more than anything to go to sleep, but instead I went into the bathroom and did a bump of coke. I’d do a bump every half hour or so,
                            pacing myself; just doing enough to feel normal. It wasn’t fun at all anymore. A bump every half hour—that was me trying to feel sober.Finally I couldn’t do it anymore. I knew if I went any further down this road, I wouldn’t
                            be able to turn around. So one night I went into the kitchen with a Glad tupperware container filled with coke. It must have been worth $800.00. I plopped it down on the counter in front of my mom and just said, “Mom, I really
                            need help. I’m doing coke all the time now.” It was the most free I’d felt in six months.I told my mom the whole story. She held it together and helped me move forward. We called my therapist, who told us about&nbsp;Phoenix
                            House’s IMPACT Program&nbsp;and said I should go in immediately. Less than two weeks later, I was in outpatient treatment.IMPACT is at Phoenix House’s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.phoenixhouse.org/locations/new-york/phoenix-house-jack-aron-center/">Jack Aron Center</a>&nbsp;on
                            the Upper West Side, and it definitely saved my life. I loved the group, but for the first few weeks I kept relapsing and failing the drug tests. I knew it was wrong but I kept saying “I need to get into college, so I need
                            to get good grades, so I need to do coke!” It’s crazy how your brain works and how your thought process gets altered with addiction. I remember thinking, “Well, they’re already pulling me out of the school early so I can come
                            to treatment, so now I&nbsp;<em>definitely&nbsp;</em>need to keep doing coke so I can keep up with my classes.”About four weeks into treatment I stopped relapsing. I began to realize there were bigger reasons for stopping and
                            getting clean that I had to confront. My little brother is probably the reason that pushed me the most to try and stay clean. He’s ten years younger than me, so when I was in treatment he was about seven. I’ll never forget:
                            one day my brother had brought all his stuffed animals into the bathtub with him, and he was washing them furiously. My mom asked him what he was doing and he said “I want them all to get clean. I want them to get clean like
                            Ana’s getting clean.” He would also draw signs with crayons that said, “No Drugs Allowed” and he’d put them on the door of his room. At some point I finally realized that my addiction wasn’t just screwing me up; it was screwing
                            him up too. That really made me come to my senses and want to change. I knew I had to do a better job, and today I know I’m being the big sister he deserves.Recovery was a long road, but was totally worth it. Eventually my
                            psychiatrist decided to put me on Adderall; she thought the reason I did coke was because I was self-medicating my undiagnosed ADD. She kept me under close supervision, making sure that I didn’t get addicted. That tradeoff,
                            combined with individual therapy and outpatient treatment at Phoenix House, really worked for me. I realized that the good thing about being an addict and being used to craziness is that you’re constantly changing—so you can
                            change for the better, too. Adderall helped me wean myself off coke, and then I weaned myself off Adderall.I’ve been clean since 2007. I’m not prescribed any medication any more and I still drink alcohol socially on occasion.
                            I graduated high school and then went on to college, graduating from the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in Advertising and Graphic Design. Today I work at an ad agency in NYC. I’ve art directed numerous ad campaigns, music videos,
                            and even a commercial featuring Jay-Z. I also love film; I just wrote and directed my first short film which is off to festivals now. My dream is to win an Oscar for directing and to just keep on truckin’ through life. I still
                            keep in touch with my counselor from Phoenix House, as well as a bunch of people from my group. So many of them are doing really well; one guy became a chef, another is working at a treatment center himself helping teenagers.
                            We had a really nice group, and it was great to be able to find recovery together.Being an addict has shaped who I’ve become, but I honestly believe it was for the better. If you’re an addict, you&nbsp;<em>can&nbsp;</em>overcome
                            your addiction and channel all that power into something creative or ambitious, and it equips you to go very far in life. Few people understand how scary and difficult it is to fight addiction, but the good news is that it’s
                            totally possible, and you’ll come out of it as a much stronger person.<br><br></p>
